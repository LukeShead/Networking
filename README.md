# Networking
This is my repo for completing all the networking tasks

Netorking is the use of systems and servers in order to allow different networks and systems to communicate with each other in order to complete tasks and achieve functions that are needed. There are many different types of networking that are used and available for use, each one has its own benefits and contraints that help certain types be better at certain tasks. In this repo I will go through the different parts of each one.

## 1.0 Networking types

### 1.1 Client-server

A client-server is a type of network that is based on the client, which is the computer that sends the request and the server which manages and sorts the request to provide the information needed from the client. This type of networking is one-sided and has the client being completely reliant on the server to gather the information needed, any form of request can be sent to a server however servers filter through requests in order to make sure that only the requests that are allowed to be sent out are sent. 

Client-servers are usually used for websites and large web applications, this is because this type of networking can provide extremely powerful servers, this means that these servers are able to hold a large amount of people at one time, this is needed for larger websites or application as the amount of users that they might hold can be very large at certain points and they need the space in order to accomidate this, client-servers can do that. 

As said before client-servers are extremely powerful and because of this can handle a lot more information and can process different users at a much faster rate than other types of networking, other than this the client-server system is quite safe and a lot of security can be added to make sure that the servers don't have a breach that can affect the system in any sort of malicious way. 

On top of this, the server is very fast and responding to requests, so much in fact, that the average time it takes for people to wait for a website to load before either re-loading or quitting the page is no more than three seconds. This means that the servers need to be quick constantly in order to address the people that will not
