# Networking
This is my repo for completing all the networking tasks

Netorking is the use of systems and servers in order to allow different networks and systems to communicate with each other in order to complete tasks and achieve functions that are needed. There are many different types of networking that are used and available for use, each one has its own benefits and contraints that help certain types be better at certain tasks. In this repo I will go through the different parts of each one.
