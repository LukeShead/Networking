# Networking
This is my repo for completing all the networking tasks

Netorking is the use of systems and servers in order to allow different networks and systems to communicate with each other in order to complete tasks and achieve functions that are needed. There are many different types of networking that are used and available for use, each one has its own benefits and contraints that help certain types be better at certain tasks. In this repo I will go through the different parts of each one.

## 1.0 Networking types

### 1.1 Client-server


A client-server is a type of network that is based on the client, which is the computer that sends the request and the server which manages and sorts the request to provide the information needed from the client. This type of networking is one-sided and has the client being completely reliant on the server to gather the information needed, any form of request can be sent to a server however servers filter through requests in order to make sure that only the requests that are allowed to be sent out are sent. 

Client-servers are usually used for websites and large web applications, this is because this type of networking can provide extremely powerful servers, this means that these servers are able to hold a large amount of people at one time, this is needed for larger websites or application as the amount of users that they might hold can be very large at certain points and they need the space in order to accomidate this, client-servers can do that. client-servers are extremely powerful and because of this can handle a lot more information and can process different users at a much faster rate than other types of networking, other than this the client-server system is quite safe and a lot of security can be added to make sure that the servers don't have a breach that can affect the system in any sort of malicious way. 

On top of the advantages of using this for websites, it also provides many methods to help reduce cost for companies, by being able to move all needs for client and server communication onto this system, it means that comapanies can focus on just having to pay for the bandwidth and internet services and can rent the servers to help keep websites and application online and functioning correctly at a much lower cost rather than having to do it themselves. 

This type of server has a dependent relationship as stated earlier, this means that the client cannot function the request without the server responding, whereas the server does not that specific client but can have multiple at once, this means it is a dependent relationship between client and server with the client being dependent on the server. When communicating with the server, the client uses internet to connect with the server, how the internet is connected can be through a wireless router, or using an ethernet cable in order to connect to the router. By having the router connect to a switch and using that, it will be able to connect to the internet and send the packets in order to get the server to recieve them and send the packets back to the client.

The server is very fast and responding to requests, so much in fact, that the average time it takes for people to wait for a website to load before either re-loading or quitting the page is no more than three seconds. This means that the servers need to be quick constantly in order to address the people that will lose interest after that short amount on time. As well having a good speed to run with, the client-server can also be very easily secured for all it's users, this is because the server can have many different types of encryptions and many different types of firewalls in order to keep information within the server that is needed within the server. Because of this, the information can be kept within the server and not be taken or provided unless it passes the protocols needed by the system, with security measures in place it means that the information is less likely to be stolen or comprimised.

This is why client-servers can be very useful, however as well as having many benefits like speed and security to using a client-server, there is also some contraints that this type of networking can have. One of the biggest contraints that a client-server networking option can be is the bandwidth of the server. Bandwidth is very important when keeping a server quick and keep its function being completed successfully, this is because the bandwidth is what dictates how many packets can travel at a time, the packets that are being sent and recieved are sent along the 'Internet Highway' they can sometimes collide with other packets of information, this is called 'Packet Collision', in this event packets will be returned or discarded and the system will have to send another request, after two requests the system will display an error message and the system will time out. By having a small amount of bandwidth it means that certain packets could get lost or discarded, this can become more and more common the lower the bandwidth is, as of such it can cost a bit more to hold the bandwidth needed for larger websites.


### 1.2 Peer to Peer

Peer to peer operates by having two people use their own LAN, in order to connect with someone else's LAN, this allows them to be able to share resources with each other in order to be able to connect with each other and communicate throughout the session.


Peer to Peer networking is usually done through small applications or gaming, it is used for having short interactions with other people, becuase of this, there is no need for a server to be used, since there is a direct connection between a short amount of systems, there is less information that is needed to be processed and retrieved. If there are two systems that connect, there is not server in between them directing the traffic or giving a stable place for packets to run though, this means that there are times in which there can be disconnections or restraints on the connection quality, this means that it is not regarded as very popular when used on much larger systems.


Peer to Peer can be very useful when being used by a company, this is because there is no direct server that is needed to be used when both systems are connecting with each other. Becuase of this, many companies can save up a lot of money and don't need to have the unnecessary costs of maintaining servers and the running costs to keep them operational. With this many companies that will be creating smaller projects that have a limited online transferring need will have a much more beneficial use of peer to peer.

The peer to peer network is created to be a connection between two or more systems who will communicate and share recources in order to connect with each other. This method does not use any form of server in order to connect, with the other user as the connection is completly handled by the two systems. Because of this it is best used for smaller sized connections, however for having a high amount of people at once this can be much worse as the connection relies on the two systems, if one fails then it can cause issues for the entire connection.

The biggest benefits for peer to peer is that it does not require any form of server or networking equipment, this means that the cost and time it takes to implement into a system is extremly lower than if it was ran through a client based server instead. As well as this having a host leave or fail does not mean the connection fails as it can select one of the other systems to be the host, this means it is safe as well as cheap to have in a small application.

The systems in peer to peer netowrks are all connected through each others switch or hub as they connect with each other directly, the IP addresses are pinged by and connected by the others and does not go through any others to get there like a server. In order to ensure there is not much packet loss, it runs through a copper straight connection to that it is quick and safer for the packets.

### 1.3 Cloud

Cloud based networking is a network model that accesses resources during a wide area network connection this is called Cloud computing and is used all over the world. Cloud networking uses something called Cloud computing this is where centralised computing resources will be shared amongst all clients within the cloud the network itself is shared to all who can access on any device.

The biggest benefits about cloud computing is the fact how it can be accessed anywhere no matter what device you are on as long as you have a stable internet connection. This can be very beneficial for companies that require employees to be separated and work on different projects on different occasions this is because you are able to edit transfer and download files off the cloud wherever you.  Having this feature means that many companies will use Cloud computing to store user information is so that it can be accessed wherever the user goes as well as this data can be saved on cloud to make sure that all sites are able to connect to the same data.


### 1.4 Cluster

A cluster computer system is where a single network of local area network will be connected by different systems they act in unison as if they were one system this can improve all forms of processing speed therefore it is quite popular this is cloud computing biggest benefit towards companies as they can use this to increase processing speed. This is done by having a single node being sent to all systems to act on the same function at the same time.

However having one single network comprised of multiple systems means that the biggest downfall of cluster networks is if one of those systems fail to function this is because they all act in unison and by one of the systems going down the rest of the systems will soon follow this is because as they act as one they all must react the same way. This can mean that it will be a very unreliable option for companies however this is only if matters like this are not properly prepared for war security measures are not prepared in advance. 

These systems that are clustered networks can be used to connect with other networks however they are much quicker in their processing power but also more unreliable because of its style of networking.

### 1.5 Centralised

A centralized network is a form of networking where a server will connect to different systems and handles all resources and user management. The server will then deliver resources and application logic to the connected systems and users, these systems are known as thin users or thin clients this is a computer with a display and basic input devices as well as a thin CPU with networking capabilities. One of the benefits that this type of networking can't have is that the hardware and the clients PC are not forced to do much of the work when handling the connection this is because the server will handle most of the resource management as well as this the server will be able to offer many different high end to the system. 

Any form of device that can be connected to a centralised system will be able to connect easily the server will do most of the heavy lifting in that the process and therefore will not require much from the system this is one of the benefits of centralised networking however one of the disadvantages of this form of networking is that if the server does collapse or fail then it means that all systems that rely on it to resource manage and help the process will have a much harder time attempting to connect with other users.


### 1.6 Virtualised

Virtualise network, as the name implies is completely virtual and not physical, by doing this it is much more cost efficient as there is no need to maintain or buy different switches or routers. One big benefit of the virtualized network is the way disasters are handled within it, because it is completely online and virtual it means that disaster recovery is much quicker and much more simple such outages that could fatally affect a server cannot affect a virtualized system in such a massive way.

A virtualized network works by combining network resources and splitting up band width in two different channels state create each channel is completely independent and is able to assign itself to a server or any form of system and there's no delay within a virtualised network all computers and devices are able to access resources from the network if it is internal.

## 2.0 Conceptual models:
In order to make sure that devices are connected properly two models are used, the first model is the transmission control protocol/ internet protocol model. This model is much shorter than the other model which is the osi model, this network model is used to have communication protocols that allow network devices to connect through the internet to a private network. TCP / IP models use client based servers as this is used for a client to ping iP addresses in order to connect. The model has four different layers that is used to check whether it will connect.

### OSI Model
The OSI model has many more layers than the TCP model, similar to the TCP model, each model will handle a different process.
The OSI model consists of these different layers: 

Application: This is the layer that is responsible for applications being provided with a networking service. Some examples of networking services are Hypertext transfer protocol (http) which is used for web pages and File transfer protocol (FTP) that is used for transferring files across networks.

Presentation: This layer is used for processing data that the application layer is able to use, this is also the layer that handles different file types and can edit their status such as changing them from compressed to open.

Session: This layer is what allows connections to be created between applications, this is also where they can be cancelled. There are different protocols that are used within this layer, the most common being (TCP) otherwise known as transmission control protocol.

Transport: As the name implies, this layer is what provides packets transport from one system to another. This layer also is responsible for handling errors that may occur during flow control.

Network: This layer is what gives data it's direction when travelling to the desire or packets that come through this layer are directed to the right route. This is where IP addresses are used the most within the osi model the route that it sends the packet down will be decided by the IP address. Because of this the network layer uses ipv4 iP addresses however there are developments of IPv6 addresses to be implemented.

Datalink: This layer is all about packet control and flow, it is responsible for encoding data when it is sent and decoding data back when reaching the destination, this is the final layer in the transportation process of packets therefore it will do checks on packets as well.

Physical: Physical is the bottom layer of the osi model it is the layer that will present the packet information to the user whether this will be in audio, video or another form of output, is dependent on the type of packet received.

### TCP/IP Model
There are four different layers that the TCP IP model uses the first is application, the second is transport, the 3rd is internet and the fourth and final is network access. Each layer handles a different part of the connection process and are all important to having a stable connection.

Application: Similar to the osi model the application layer is responsible for providing applications with a working network service such as HTTP and DNS. This layer is what allows different applications to communicate and transfer data between them, without this layer working the applications would not have a working service to handle their protocols.

Transport: This layer is what controls the packets transportation from one system to another within the network, the journey of the packets are controlled and maintained within this layer. Like the osi model its uses TCP as a protocol. If this layer was to fail then packets could be lost or sent to different location than originally planned.

Network Access: Where has the OSI's bottom model is a physical output, the lowest layer of TCP is more than that, this layer is what checks the packets as they are received whilst encoding and decoding data. This also provides a physical output to the user.
