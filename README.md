# Networking
This is my repo for completing all the networking tasks

Netorking is the use of systems and servers in order to allow different networks and systems to communicate with each other in order to complete tasks and achieve functions that are needed. There are many different types of networking that are used and available for use, each one has its own benefits and contraints that help certain types be better at certain tasks. In this repo I will go through the different parts of each one.

## 1.0 Networking types

### 1.1 Client-server

A client-server is a type of network that is based on the client, which is the computer that sends the request and the server which manages and sorts the request to provide the information needed from the client. This type of networking is one-sided and has the client being completely reliant on the server to gather the information needed, any form of request can be sent to a server however servers filter through requests in order to make sure that only the requests that are allowed to be sent out are sent. 

Client-servers are usually used for websites and large web applications, this is because this type of networking can provide extremely powerful servers, this means that these servers are able to hold a large amount of people at one time, this is needed for larger websites or application as the amount of users that they might hold can be very large at certain points and they need the space in order to accomidate this, client-servers can do that. client-servers are extremely powerful and because of this can handle a lot more information and can process different users at a much faster rate than other types of networking, other than this the client-server system is quite safe and a lot of security can be added to make sure that the servers don't have a breach that can affect the system in any sort of malicious way. 

On top of the advantages of using this for websites, it also provides many methods to help reduce cost for companies, by being able to move all needs for client and server communication onto this system, it means that comapanies can focus on just having to pay for the bandwidth and internet services and can rent the servers to help keep websites and application online and functioning correctly at a much lower cost rather than having to do it themselves. 

This type of server has a dependent relationship as stated earlier, this means that the client cannot function the request without the server responding, whereas the server does not that specific client but can have multiple at once, this means it is a dependent relationship between client and server with the client being dependent on the server. When communicating with the server, the client uses internet to connect with the server, how the internet is connected can be through a wireless router, or using an ethernet cable in order to connect to the router. By having the router connect to a switch and using that, it will be able to connect to the internet and send the packets in order to get the server to recieve them and send the packets back to the client.

The server is very fast and responding to requests, so much in fact, that the average time it takes for people to wait for a website to load before either re-loading or quitting the page is no more than three seconds. This means that the servers need to be quick constantly in order to address the people that will lose interest after that short amount on time. As well having a good speed to run with, the client-server can also be very easily secured for all it's users, this is because the server can have many different types of encryptions and many different types of firewalls in order to keep information within the server that is needed within the server. Because of this, the information can be kept within the server and not be taken or provided unless it passes the protocols needed by the system, with security measures in place it means that the information is less likely to be stolen or comprimised.

This is why client-servers can be very useful, however as well as having many benefits like speed and security to using a client-server, there is also some contraints that this type of networking can have. One of the biggest contraints that a client-server networking option can be is the bandwidth of the server. Bandwidth is very important when keeping a server quick and keep its function being completed successfully, this is because the bandwidth is what dictates how many packets can travel at a time, the packets that are being sent and recieved are sent along the 'Internet Highway' they can sometimes collide with other packets of information, this is called 'Packet Collision', in this event packets will be returned or discarded and the system will have to send another request, after two requests the system will display an error message and the system will time out. By having a small amount of bandwidth it means that certain packets could get lost or discarded, this can become more and more common the lower the bandwidth is, as of such it can cost a bit more to hold the bandwidth needed for larger websites.


### 1.2 Peer to Peer

Peer to peer operates by having two people use their own LAN, in order to connect with someone else's LAN, this allows them to be able to share resources with each other in order to be able to connect with each other and communicate throughout the session.


Peer to Peer networking is usually done through small applications or gaming, it is used for having short interactions with other people, becuase of this, there is no need for a server to be used, since there is a direct connection between a short amount of systems, there is less information that is needed to be processed and retrieved. If there are two systems that connect, there is not server in between them directing the traffic or giving a stable place for packets to run though, this means that there are times in which there can be disconnections or restraints on the connection quality, this means that it is not regarded as very popular when used on much larger systems.

Peer to Peer can be very useful when being used by a company, this is because there is no direct server that is needed to be used when both systems are connecting with each other. Becuase of this, many companies can save up a lot of money and don't need to have the unnecessary costs of maintaining servers and the running costs to keep them operational. With this many companies that will be creating smaller projects that have a limited online transferring need will have a much more beneficial use of peer to peer.

The peer to peer network is created to be a connection between two or more systems who will communicate and share recources in order to connect with each other. This method does not use any form of server in order to connect, with the other user as the connection is completly handled by the two systems. Because of this it is best used for smaller sized connections, however for having a high amount of people at once this can be much worse as the connection relies on the two systems, if one fails then it can cause issues for the entire connection.

The biggest benefits for peer to peer is that it does not require any form of server or networking equipment, this means that the cost and time it takes to implement into a system is extremly lower than if it was ran through a client based server instead. As well as this having a host leave or fail does not mean the connection fails as it can select one of the other systems to be the host, this means it is safe as well as cheap to have in a small application.

The systems in peer to peer netowrks are all connected through each others switch or hub as they connect with each other directly, the IP addresses are pinged by and connected by the others and does not go through any others to get there like a server. In order to ensure there is not much packet loss, it runs through a copper straight connection to that it is quick and safer for the packets.

### 1.3 Cloud

Cloud based networking is a network model that accesses resources during a wide area network connection this is called Cloud computing and is used all over the world. Cloud networking uses something called Cloud computing this is where centralised computing resources will be shared amongst all clients within the cloud the network itself is shared to all who can access on any device.

The biggest benefits about cloud computing is the fact how it can be accessed anywhere no matter what device you are on as long as you have a stable internet connection. This can be very beneficial for companies that require employees to be separated and work on different projects on different occasions this is because you are able to edit transfer and download files off the cloud wherever you.  Having this feature means that many companies will use Cloud computing to store user information is so that it can be accessed wherever the user goes as well as this data can be saved on cloud to make sure that all sites are able to connect to the same data.


### 1.4 Cluster

A cluster computer system is where a single network of local area network will be connected by different systems they act in unison as if they were one system this can improve all forms of processing speed therefore it is quite popular this is cloud computing biggest benefit towards companies as they can use this to increase processing speed. This is done by having a single node being sent to all systems to act on the same function at the same time.

However having one single network comprised of multiple systems means that the biggest downfall of cluster networks is if one of those systems fail to function this is because they all act in unison and by one of the systems going down the rest of the systems will soon follow this is because as they act as one they all must react the same way. This can mean that it will be a very unreliable option for companies however this is only if matters like this are not properly prepared for war security measures are not prepared in advance. 

These systems that are clustered networks can be used to connect with other networks however they are much quicker in their processing power but also more unreliable because of its style of networking.

### 1.5 Centralised

A centralized network is a form of networking where a server will connect to different systems and handles all resources and user management. The server will then deliver resources and application logic to the connected systems and users, these systems are known as thin users or thin clients this is a computer with a display and basic input devices as well as a thin CPU with networking capabilities. One of the benefits that this type of networking can't have is that the hardware and the clients PC are not forced to do much of the work when handling the connection this is because the server will handle most of the resource management as well as this the server will be able to offer many different high end to the system. 

Any form of device that can be connected to a centralised system will be able to connect easily the server will do most of the heavy lifting in that the process and therefore will not require much from the system this is one of the benefits of centralised networking however one of the disadvantages of this form of networking is that if the server does collapse or fail then it means that all systems that rely on it to resource manage and help the process will have a much harder time attempting to connect with other users.


### 1.6 Virtualised

Virtualise network, as the name implies is completely virtual and not physical, by doing this it is much more cost efficient as there is no need to maintain or buy different switches or routers. One big benefit of the virtualized network is the way disasters are handled within it, because it is completely online and virtual it means that disaster recovery is much quicker and much more simple such outages that could fatally affect a server cannot affect a virtualized system in such a massive way.

A virtualized network works by combining network resources and splitting up band width in two different channels state create each channel is completely independent and is able to assign itself to a server or any form of system and there's no delay within a virtualised network all computers and devices are able to access resources from the network if it is internal.

## 2.0 Conceptual models:
In order to make sure that devices are connected properly two models are used, the first model is the transmission control protocol/ internet protocol model. This model is much shorter than the other model which is the osi model, this network model is used to have communication protocols that allow network devices to connect through the internet to a private network. TCP / IP models use client based servers as this is used for a client to ping iP addresses in order to connect. The model has four different layers that is used to check whether it will connect.

![TCP/OSI](https://github.com/LukeShead/Networking/blob/master/TCP%20and%20OSI%20model.jpg)


### OSI Model
The OSI model has many more layers than the TCP model, similar to the TCP model, each model will handle a different process.
The OSI model consists of these different layers: 

Application: This is the layer that is responsible for applications being provided with a networking service. Some examples of networking services are Hypertext transfer protocol (http) which is used for web pages and File transfer protocol (FTP) that is used for transferring files across networks.

Presentation: This layer is used for processing data that the application layer is able to use, this is also the layer that handles different file types and can edit their status such as changing them from compressed to open.

Session: This layer is what allows connections to be created between applications, this is also where they can be cancelled. There are different protocols that are used within this layer, the most common being (TCP) otherwise known as transmission control protocol.

Transport: As the name implies, this layer is what provides packets transport from one system to another. This layer also is responsible for handling errors that may occur during flow control.

Network: This layer is what gives data it's direction when travelling to the desire or packets that come through this layer are directed to the right route. This is where IP addresses are used the most within the osi model the route that it sends the packet down will be decided by the IP address. Because of this the network layer uses ipv4 iP addresses however there are developments of IPv6 addresses to be implemented.

Datalink: This layer is all about packet control and flow, it is responsible for encoding data when it is sent and decoding data back when reaching the destination, this is the final layer in the transportation process of packets therefore it will do checks on packets as well.

Physical: Physical is the bottom layer of the osi model it is the layer that will present the packet information to the user whether this will be in audio, video or another form of output, is dependent on the type of packet received.

### TCP/IP Model
There are four different layers that the TCP IP model uses the first is application, the second is transport, the 3rd is internet and the fourth and final is network access. Each layer handles a different part of the connection process and are all important to having a stable connection.

Application: Similar to the osi model the application layer is responsible for providing applications with a working network service such as HTTP and DNS. This layer is what allows different applications to communicate and transfer data between them, without this layer working the applications would not have a working service to handle their protocols.

Transport: This layer is what controls the packets transportation from one system to another within the network, the journey of the packets are controlled and maintained within this layer. Like the osi model its uses TCP as a protocol. If this layer was to fail then packets could be lost or sent to different location than originally planned.

Network Access: Where has the OSI's bottom model is a physical output, the lowest layer of TCP is more than that, this layer is what checks the packets as they are received whilst encoding and decoding data. This also provides a physical output to the user.


## Standards and Protocols

Physical Cabling and Data Transmission

### IEEE 802.3
This is the standard for its ethernet connections. The type of connection that is used for this is mostly physical there are some products that simulate ethernet however normal ethernet cables will be physical. With this standard there are many updates each one add new additional features and elements to it, one of the standards that must be met is that speeds must be of at least 1.25 MB/s. This standard is primarily used for LAN however can be used for WAN.

### IEEE 802.7
This is the typical recommended broadband LAN standard, the main thing that is specified when looking at the standard is the type of design testing and form of installation when using broadband cable Technologies.

### IEEE 802.8
This standard is very similar to the one above, however this is used for fibre optic within a LAN, the recommendations for testing and other forms of configuration are the same except it is a different connection type,

### IEEE 802.11
This refers to the standard of connecting through wireless devices, this includes the most popular form of connection, wi-Fi, the standard is about what forms of frequencies are being used when using access points and other network devices.

### Routed Protocols
Routed protocol is the term that is used when describing the process of using protocols to decide how data is transferred from one system to another, the only protocol that are left with in networking is IPv6 and it's earlier version ipv4. Many protocols that are followed with networking have a shorter lifespan than expected and as of such can lead to many protocols being abandoned. This is apparent when looking at ipv4 now instead of IPv6, ipv4 allowed multiple billion addresses that were able to be used when giving a system an IP address. However, at this point in time addresses are starting to run out in ipv4, to help solve this problem IPv6 has been invented and this allows a vastly bigger amount of addresses to be used.

Services and network applications:

### FTP
As the name suggests, file transfer protocol is a protocol that Focuses on the transfer of files over two networks, this type of protocol requires a server and a client who is able to edit multiple files using FTP, in order to use FTP there must be some servers that can be logged into in order to gain access to the files transferred.

### HTTP
HTTP or hypertext transfer protocol is a protocol used by all of the internet, it is a protocol that governs the actions in which web servers or browsers need to take in order to respond to user commands. Http can be very helpful towards a user by offering help with the website such as display, this allows a much faster load time.

### SMTP
SMTP stands for simple mail transfer protocol and is the protocol used for emailing other networks between servers. The protocol is used to connect to servers that allow messages that a clients can receive from another client.

### POP3
Similar to how SMTP works, POP3 is also known as post office protocol is a protocol in which it's allowed clients to receive emails this type of protocol get updated a lot with each update it allows more features and easier use of receiving emails.

### SSL
This stands for secure sockets layer, it is the security technology standard that allows encrypted linking between web servers and browsers, it ensures that data that could be sensitive is sent securely to, this includes data such as addresses or debit card information.

## The Impact of Networking Topology, Communication and Bandwidth


### Topologies

Networking topologies are the rules in which networks or made, apologies all have been designed for different purposes, because of this they all have their times in which they are the strongest and also the weakest choice. 

* The first topology is the mesh topology, this is where multiple connections between multiple systems are connected on a network, this means that they all operate faster but also if one system fails so do the rest.

* The second topology is the ring topology, this is simply where the network has been arranged in order to form a circular like network, what this means is that every device will be connected to two devices on either side of it. This can be very beneficial in terms of organisation however is not the most reliable choice.

* The third topology is the bus topology, this is a very simple and Common apology where every single component within the network are all connected on a single line. This means that the cable length can be quite short however it can be difficult to figure out any issues with the network when it fails as everything fails at once.

* The fourth topology is the star topology, this is where the machines are connected or to a single hub or sometimes a switch that is placed at the centre of the network. This is why it has the name star network, as the connections branch out to give the look of a star.

### Communication
Similar to how people communicate, communication on a network is where two systems will receive and send data or packets to each other over a network. When a user request data from a server, it has to communicate to make sure that user gets what they are looking for, so if the user wants a certain website, the server must provide that exact website. This is where many security risks are available to be exploited, this is because there are many different packets moving in and out being transferred by different systems, with this mini packets, there are many malicious hackers that will try to steal certain data. This is why systems like firewalls exist, having different forms of security measures can sometimes impact the speed of transfer between packets, if there are security checks within a router and server as well as firewalls to back it up then it can be much slower than if there were no security measures, of course this would be much more dangerous as there would be nothing stopping any form of malicious software or packets from stealing data. There are times in which servers will fail to communicate such as any other system, this is very rare how weather can happen, because of this the system is usually setup to send multiple packets with each request in case some are lost.

### Operating Principles

#### Networking devices

##### Hubs
Hubs serve as a primary connection point for many devices within a network. The Hub is made to connect all systems within a local network, it contains multiple ports so that it is able to connect with a variety of devices, as well as this it is usually centered in the middle of the network so that all devices can connect easily.

##### Routers
Routers are devices that have the purpose of connecting routers to other networks, by allowing a router to connect to another router on a separate network, the router can act as the gateway in order to route packets towards their desired destination allowing connections further out from LAN and into WAN.
##### Switches
Switches are devices that also connect different systems onto a network, what is different is that it uses a method called packet switching to process packets, information and data and then allow them to proceed.

##### Multilayer Switch
A multiplayer switch is similar to a normal switch how whether, this switch has the function of being able to perform the functions of a router as well, it is primarily stronger than the switch in terms of power and speed and is also considered faster than most routers.

##### Firewall
Firewalls have the functions of protecting different packets and also removing malicious packets from entering a system or client end device. It does this by having a set filter, and if these requirements are not met, then the firewall will block the packets that don't meet them.

##### HIDS
This is also known as host - based intrusion detection system, it specializes in monitoring internal components in a system. It will scan for any malicious packets when scanning the system, every packet is monitored and analysed and if it is malicious it is then reported.

##### Repeaters
Are used to repair signals that have been distorted, if a transmission system is having issues with loss of signal, then the Repeater will be able to fix the issue and also in the process, relay the messages back to the network if needed. It can also strengthen signals on networks, this allows for a greater size LAN.

##### Bridges
A bridge similar to the physical world, is used to connect different networks together, this can be very beneficial most of the time however the protocols on each Bridge must be the same. If they are not then access will be denied, this is because the internal database that the bridge uses has the power to determine what packets enter and leave the network, if they are not matching then they will not allow certain packets.

##### Access Point
Access points are usually found in most homes, their purpose is to provide a wireless connection to the network, they do not have to be physically connected to that network and can provide connection to the LAN for all systems with the means to connect to it.

##### Content Filter
A content filter, as the name suggests its purpose is to filter any content so that certain unwanted packets will be prevented from entering the network. It will determine a certain filter that is necessary for the network, if there are any packets that do not match with the filter, similar to a firewall they will not be allowed access.

##### Load Balancer
A load balancer is able to shorten the amount of time packets take to travel across the network by distributing traffic along different lanes that it creates. This can be very beneficial to networks that require a high-speed of service.

##### Modem
The modem functions by transmitting different data and packets across cable lines, this is also used when using a telephone connection and is what allows telephones and mobiles to connect.

##### Packet Shaper
The packet shaper is a program that allows more high priority packets to be prioritised higher than other traffic going in and out the network, this means that more important packets will have more security and faster speed of transfer.

##### VPN Concentrator
A VPN concentrator is a device that functions by providing a delivery service between VPN nodes, it will also provide a secure connection for the transfer between nodes. By doing this it means that there can be multiple systems accessing the VPN at the same time as they will be able to deal with the packets faster.

#### Server types

##### Web
A web server is what allows users to see different types of content over the internet, this is done by having a request sent by the client to a web server, if the server can provide and it is not of any malicious or does not break the filtered requirements, then it will fetch the required page or website allowing it to be sent back to the client to give the user what they want.

##### File
A file server is a server that functions by storing and managing different types of files, these files are stored on the network so that any system that accesses that network can see the files. This means that users on the same network will be able to easily transfer files and share data without much delay.

##### Database
A database server can be physical or software based, it is used to provide storage for users information and data that can be used later on. There are two different types of database servers, one is called a back-end server, the other is a front-end server. The differences between our that the database can run on a user's system or have a system dedicated to a server. The information or data that is stored within a database can be referred back to and can also be seen by any user who accesses it.

##### Combination
A company server has the function to combine multiple functions of different servers above, it can allow web, file and database servers different functions two all enter one server that can provide the same service.

##### Terminal Services
A terminal server is a server that will provide different forms of terminals, the systems that can access the terminals are able to connect without needing a form of modem as long as another type of Port is used.

##### Virtualisation
A virtualized server is a server that has been changed from a physical server into a virtual server, this is done by having the physical server broken up into smaller servers that are also assisted by one or multiple software's. These servers can provide multiple services that other servers can provide such as web or database how weather, the benefit to virtualized servers is that it forms its own individual server there for needing less hardware to power physical.

## Workstation Hardware

##### Networking Software
A networking software is needed when trying to create and maintain a network, it is used when modifying different types of network including LAN and WAN. There are many different types of networks.

###### Client Software
This is a software that requires input from the client in order to complete it's function, or it's function can be to offer the client the means to input certain information in order to get a specific output. An example of this is Microsoft Access.

###### Server Software
Server software is a software that is designed to help a server completes tasks, this can be for many different functions, for example if a server software allows the server to recieve and send emails, it means that the server can now act as an email hosting server as well as it's primary function.

###### Client Operating System
The client operating software usually has the function of allowing a system to have the ability to operate on it's own and complete it's own functions. This can improve productivity with the system and can allow the system complete more tasks, for example web browsing.

###### Server Operating system
This operating system is the same as a client operating system but with a server, this allows different types of functions to be implemented within the server that are different from it's primary function, this can help the server perform actions such as packet handling as well as usual functions. 


### Comparison of network and cabling


#### Networking Comparison 
A network card is a certain type of device that allows a computer system to connect with a wireless connection. The card is able to exchange data between a suitable protocol to achieve a stable connection at within the network. Many home PCs have network cards in order to connect to a private connection, this means the use of ethernet cables is not needed. It does this by identifying radio waves and other forms of wireless connections and can rely on them, this also means connections such as cellular.

Network cards are very reliable, however they are not the only method of connection, as mentioned earlier the Ethernet port requires a wired connection between the network and the system. The ethernet connection usually has a higher rate of speed in the network, however in order to set up an ethernet connection, it can be much more of a nuisance as all ethernet connections are dealt with through physical cables.

#### Cabling used
Ethernet connections and other forms of wired connections require cabling to be used with its methods, these cables are usually copper or other forms of metal as it runs electrical signals across them in order to connect different systems together, the cables are able to transfer data between the two endpoints very easily, this means they are usually better than wireless in the terms of service. 

Three main types of cables that are used within networking are:

##### Patch Cables
Patch cables are the most common form of cable is used when connecting devices together, the cable serve a better purpose when connecting devices such as a client end device, a switch or router, this is because they are primarily built for signal writing, this means that they are much better at transferring data between these two devices than other cables.

##### Shielded Cables
Similar to how the patch cables works, the shielded cables also transmits data, however it is not primarily built for signal router, this is because it is usually comprised of strands of copper, the reason they are called shielded cables is because they reduce electrical noise from affecting radio signals that are being transmitted across it. This is done by adding different layers of copper tape or a form of polymer, these allow the cable to reduce the noise created when transferring data.

##### Twisted pair
A twisted pair cable is a form of cable that does not use straight copper wires, instead it is called a twisted pair as the wires contain a twisted cable, the copper or other metallic elements of wire is twisted into a form of braided wire, allowing for less crosstalk or possibly any form of electromagnetic interference when transferring data, this can protect any packets that might be lost due to the interference.


### Permissions
Permissions are a security protocol that is used to help keep out unwanted packets or data, the idea is that different user's of end systems or networking devices will be able to set their own permissions and requirements for entry, the permissions can be set through admin privileges on these devices as it is the primary security protocol that allows unwanted data to be transferred, there are different forms of permissions that can be installed within a device or network, here are two of them.

#### NTFS
NTFS is a form of permissions that are primarily set for shared folders, the type of permissions allow the people that are able to access them full control over the files accessed, this means that they are able to delete or edit files as well as just review their contents. NTFS is a very flexible option as it gives the user's the right to edit all forms of files within a network, this can mean that all forms of needs can be sated from using this.

#### Shared Permissions
Share permissions are very similar to NTFS however what they do not have in common are that the procedures are only set for files shared within a network, the permissions can be different levels of security and access which allows only the right people to view higher priority folders depending on what level their access is.

### Local workstation Architecture
Other than just normal home pCs, there are another form of computers that are more specialised towards completing a set task or tasks, these are called workstation computers and are made to be able to complete different tasks at a much faster rate than a personal computer could. It is very similar to a private home computer however this type of computer is always connected onto the LA that it is under, this allows it to share its resources and also process resources with the LAN network. Specialised computer usually will have a much better processor than a private computer, this is because it will need to run more tasks and also may require the extra memory and clock speed to help keep up with all the data being transferred. There are many different uses of workstation computers how whether they can be quite costly in order to obtain.

#### System Bus
A system bus is a form of connection that can carry data between the microprocessor of the computer and the main memory of the computer, by allowing this form of connection, it is able to provide a straight communication pathway in order to transfer data back and forth. The data is usually carried within the motherboard however can also be carried between the CPU and possibly other components. The address of the bus is where the data will be sent and will determine the route for the data when sent, the control of the system bus is used to identify the type of operation the data requires when it arrives at its destination.


## Creating my own networked system to meet a required specification

The type of network that I used to meet this specification was a star based network, all devices within this network were all connected to the main switch at the centre of the network, by having two different lands it meant that two star networks were created in order to use a router to connect both.


![Design of network](https://github.com/LukeShead/Networking/blob/master/Network%20design.JPG)


### Specification

The specification that was given was:

Network Design Requirements

#### Local Network 1 AKA: Springfield
You are required to design a local STAR network connected via a switch to 3 PCs, 1 Server and 1 router

The PCs should use IPs:

* 192.168.1.100
* 192.168.1.101
* 192.168.1.102
The Server should use the IP:

* 192.168.1.10
The Router (aka Gateway) should use the IP:

* 192.168.1.1

#### Local Network 2 AKA: QUAHOG
You are required to design a local STAR network connected via a switch to 3 PCs, 1 Server and 1 router

The PCs should use IPs:

* 192.168.10.100
* 192.168.10.101
* 192.168.10.102
The Server should use the IP:

* 192.168.10.10
The Router (or Gateway) should use the IP:

* 192.168.10.1


### Designing the system
When designing the network, each system was taken and put into a position that could be used in order to meet the given specification, With the 8 different systems, 6 being computers and the other 2 being servers, they all required to have a unique IP address in order to allow the others to connect with it. As well as this they all required to be able to run through a switch and router to connect two different LAN’s. 

When looking at the specification of the network, I decided to use a star type network as it was the most commonly used network type of this kind of task, by having a star network it is able to keep a strong connection to the switch, as well as this it is able to look neat and organised if anything is to be done. When using it cabling, I decided to use copper straight through, this was to make sure that it was the easiest and simplest to understand and identify where connections were made, however do routers have to be connected by a serial DTE, this was because it is a long range connection of two LAN's.

### How the design helped ne 
I planned and designed the network on draw.io; this is because there are many different tools that can be used in order to successfully re-create the look for what the network will look like. Using this design helped me create a working network as I was able to plan how the connections would work from the start of the development, it also meant that I could use it as a reference if I needed to be reminded of what the network was meant to look like and was able to work off it because of that.

After creating the design, I was able to look at each network component and decide how to utilise them in order to make the network successful, the design was a lot more simple and did not go in depth into what was the purpose of each of the systems were. However instead of using the design for this I was able to use it to use it in order to make sure that I had a strong base to build the network, the design is what dictated how the network would be structured and was where I could plan it all without needing to invest as much time as I would if I tested as I built the network.

### Testing the network with user feedback
When testing my network, I used simple tests with the purpose of making sure that the network was able to connect to the other systems, for example the computers being able to use the router in order to connect with another LAN in order to ping computers within it. In order to make sure that I tested all of the possible areas to prove that the cluster 	network was fully functional, I used a test plan that was able to look at all different aspects of the network, this includes being able to ping the different systems within the network and allowing them to access the other LAN.

After testing the network myself, I wanted user feedback from real life individuals to see what they thought about the network,

##### Joe:
Joe stated that the network was easy to understand since the star network easy to identify, when testing this with Joe, there were no issues when pinging a different systems, overall good feedback.

##### Mark:
Mark's comment on the system at work very similar to Joe's however, mark stated that the labeling was a little bit messy and would do good for a clean up, when testing this network there were no issues that occurred.

### Evaluation

The network that I had designed had been made to keep in mind all the requirements that were needed, all of the requirements were met with this network and when tested, the network worked as planned. The choice to use a star topology in order for the switch to transfer data back and forth easily, paid off heavily, this was because the pings were able to go through the network quickly and with no interference from any devices. The connections were copper straight through and I believe this was a good decision since the size of the network did not require much cabling to be used, because of this the copper straight through was the impressed and also cheapest type of connection to get, it also allowed to clear View of what devices were connected with each other. 

The only issues I found with the network were to do with the star topology, this was the fact that if one device was to shut down such as the switch or router, then no packets would be able to be received from the other systems, this is because this which is the primary device within the star topology. By having the switch as the primary device centered in the network, it means that all devices must go through it in order to pick, this means that the switch needs to be working and completing its function successfully in order for things to be successful. 

This is where I could have possibly used another form of topology, doing this may of helped some of the issues that I encountered during the creation of this network, for example when connecting all of the systems, any issues with the switch had to be dealt with first before any of them could pick up to each other despite configuring them all successfully. Using the feedback that I got from the testing, I was able to look at my network and see the strengths and some of the flaws when viewing it, the cabling was easy to understand how whether the labeling was messy due to the star topology having all the systems close together. Another aspect I could have added onto the network is some security measures, there were very few security measures implemented such as a firewall was missing, adding this could have helped the network look more stable rather than being vulnerable to attacks. 

In conclusion, the network met all requirements needed and the function for its use can be very beneficial for a small private network, in future I will be able to use this network to look at the weaknesses and strengths of certain topologies and be able to work upon that in order to design better networks in the future.
