# Networking
This is my repo for completing all the networking tasks

Netorking is the use of systems and servers in order to allow different networks and systems to communicate with each other in order to complete tasks and achieve functions that are needed. There are many different types of networking that are used and available for use, each one has its own benefits and contraints that help certain types be better at certain tasks. In this repo I will go through the different parts of each one.

## 1.0 Networking types

### 1.1 Client-server


A client-server is a type of network that is based on the client, which is the computer that sends the request and the server which manages and sorts the request to provide the information needed from the client. This type of networking is one-sided and has the client being completely reliant on the server to gather the information needed, any form of request can be sent to a server however servers filter through requests in order to make sure that only the requests that are allowed to be sent out are sent. 

##### Use
Client-servers are usually used for websites and large web applications, this is because this type of networking can provide extremely powerful servers, this means that these servers are able to hold a large amount of people at one time, this is needed for larger websites or application as the amount of users that they might hold can be very large at certain points and they need the space in order to accomidate this, client-servers can do that. client-servers are extremely powerful and because of this can handle a lot more information and can process different users at a much faster rate than other types of networking, other than this the client-server system is quite safe and a lot of security can be added to make sure that the servers don't have a breach that can affect the system in any sort of malicious way. 

##### Business needs
On top of the advantages of using this for websites, it also provides many methods to help reduce cost for companies, by being able to move all needs for client and server communication onto this system, it means that comapanies can focus on just having to pay for the bandwidth and internet services and can rent the servers to help keep websites and application online and functioning correctly at a much lower cost rather than having to do it themselves. 

##### communication
This type of server has a dependent relationship as stated earlier, this means that the client cannot function the request without the server responding, whereas the server does not that specific client but can have multiple at once, this means it is a dependent relationship between client and server with the client being dependent on the server. When communicating with the server, the client uses internet to connect with the server, how the internet is connected can be through a wireless router, or using an ethernet cable in order to connect to the router. By having the router connect to a switch and using that, it will be able to connect to the internet and send the packets in order to get the server to recieve them and send the packets back to the client.

##### Benfits of use
The server is very fast and responding to requests, so much in fact, that the average time it takes for people to wait for a website to load before either re-loading or quitting the page is no more than three seconds. This means that the servers need to be quick constantly in order to address the people that will lose interest after that short amount on time. As well having a good speed to run with, the client-server can also be very easily secured for all it's users, this is because the server can have many different types of encryptions and many different types of firewalls in order to keep information within the server that is needed within the server. Because of this, the information can be kept within the server and not be taken or provided unless it passes the protocols needed by the system, with security measures in place it means that the information is less likely to be stolen or comprimised.

##### Constraints of use
This is why client-servers can be very useful, however as well as having many benefits like speed and security to using a client-server, there is also some contraints that this type of networking can have. One of the biggest contraints that a client-server networking option can be is the bandwidth of the server. Bandwidth is very important when keeping a server quick and keep its function being completed successfully, this is because the bandwidth is what dictates how many packets can travel at a time, the packets that are being sent and recieved are sent along the 'Internet Highway' they can sometimes collide with other packets of information, this is called 'Packet Collision', in this event packets will be returned or discarded and the system will have to send another request, after two requests the system will display an error message and the system will time out. By having a small amount of bandwidth it means that certain packets could get lost or discarded, this can become more and more common the lower the bandwidth is, as of such it can cost a bit more to hold the bandwidth needed for larger websites.


### Peer to Peer

Peer to peer operates by having two people use their own LAN, in order to connect with someone else's LAN, this allows them to be able to share resources with each other in order to be able to connect with each other and communicate throughout the session
